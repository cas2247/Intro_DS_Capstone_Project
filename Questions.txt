Preliminary questions to ask of the dataset and perform EDA on:


1. What are the least desirable attributes in male partners? Does this differ from female partners?

2. How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection versus it's real impact?

3. Are shared interested more important than shared racial background in finding a match?

4. Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?

5. In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?

6. Can we accurately predict whether someone will be asked on a second date based on their date's survey response? What attributes matter most?

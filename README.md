# Masters Intro to Data Science Capstone Project

The purpose of this repo is to share code and results related to the final capstone project for Intro to Data Science.

## Project Details
Details for the project (copied from the course Sittyba) are the following:


Is designed to tie together the skills you learned in this class. The capstone
project is done in small teams of 2-5 people and uses a dataset of your choosing. The deliverable
work product is a 5 page project report. We will release a spec sheet as to what we would like to see
in this report at the end of the semester. The dataset you choose and the problem you want to tackle
should be something that sparks joy. The project report is also something you will be able to use in
your portfolio for job applications. Recommendation: Find a topic you are interested in and then a
dataset (the richer, the better) that pertains to that topic. Follow along with the class – ie pick a
dataset and problem, then apply hypothesis testing, regression and machine learning methods, in
that order (the 5 page paper should have 5 sections: 
    1: Intro, 
    2: Hypothesis testing analysis, 
    3:Regression analysis, 
    4: ML analysis. 
    5: Overall summary and conclusions). 

But this just a recommendation – it is not the only possible structure. You could also focus on one of these blocks.

## Dataset
The dataset we will analyze for this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment

### DESCRIPTION
Match and questionnaire data from speed dating experiment run by Columbia professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar

### SUMMARY
What influences love at first sight? (Or, at least, love in the first four minutes?) This dataset was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.

Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document below for details.
